 ## Figurine holder

This is a simple box to hold tabletop figurines. I used it to safely store some that a friend has printed and painted for me.
As I don't want to break it when I take my game to friends, I have created a simple box for that.
I already had one for other figurines from Fallout board game, for which I have printed [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4836909). There is a holder for the figs, that I found useful. I did not reuse it, as I needed 16 slots, and a cap that was not needed in the fallout box.

I made it as much configurable as I thought. You can change the number of available slots, the width and height of each, the thickness of walls, the thickness of base...

Feel free to use, improve, put PR if you want clearer code (I think I could have used more vars :D)

I also have uploaded it to thingiverse, with configurable option enabled, just [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6279478)
